# NHL Goalies and their Save Stats 

Datalink: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/open-source-sports/professional-hockey-database

This dataset includes information on the measurable statistics in hockey starting in 1909 and ending in 2011. I will be exploring whether a goalie's height play a role in being a better puck stopper. I will be looking at the correlation between the physical attributes and the statistics of Save Percentage and Goals Against Average.

My working theory is that the bigger a goalie is, they cover more of the net so they can stop the puck more often.
